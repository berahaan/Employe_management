In this project, I utilized the Mern stack to allow the administrator (assigned as HR) to edit, delete, update, and 
view basic employee records. The system also includes a robust authentication mechanism to track user visits.
first i have prepared a registration page s when a users can registers based on role then log in and access the pages ,the systems also
have robust mechanism to track a user session  I have also prepared role other than Hr like manager,normaluser for testing purpose only and only User with Hr role can 
edit ,delete,updates and see the information of employees thats all .
