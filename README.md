This project implements a comprehensive Employee Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with authentication and role-based access control.
Features
CRUD Operations: Allows HR administrators to Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
Role-based Access Control: Users register with specific roles (HR, Manager, Normal User) and access corresponding functionalities upon login.
Authentication and Session Management: Secure authentication mechanisms and session management ensure user data protection and restrict unauthorized access.
Usage
Registration and Login:

Authentication ensures only registered users can access the system.
Role-specific Access:
